# Contracts Directory

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for API contracts, schemas, and interface definitions. However, for the feature-based architecture refactoring project, no external contracts are needed since this is a purely structural change.

## Why No Contracts?
The refactoring involves moving and reorganizing existing code without changing:
- API endpoints or responses
- External service integrations
- Data schemas or database models
- Public interfaces or contracts

## Future Use
If this project evolves to include API changes or new integrations, contracts would be documented here in OpenAPI/JSON Schema format.
